Task 01: Check if a Number is Even or Odd
we take input from the user named 'n1'
then we run a program which state that if the number divided by 2 and if remainder i equal to 0 then it is a even number and if remainder not equal to 0 then it is an odd number.
n1=int(input("enter a number:"))
if n1%2==0 :
    print(n1, "is even number.")
else:
    print(n1," is odd number.")
we get the result well.

Task 02:Sum of Integers from 1 to 50 Using a Loop
we initialize the value as 'total_sum' equal to 0.
we run a for loop to calculate the sum of natural number from 1 to 50.
the we print the value 'total_sum' and get result as
sum of the numbers from 1 to 50 is: 1275
